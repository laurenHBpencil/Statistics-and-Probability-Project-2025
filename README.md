Module: Statistics and Probability
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel, R

Overview
This project demonstrates the application of statistical analysis and probability concepts using Excel and R. It includes:
Calculations of Binomial, Normal and Poisson probabilities.
Descriptive statistics of weather data.
Regression analysis on diamond prices.
Visual data analysis through scatter plots and fitted regression lines.

Project Contents
LaurenBrampton_StatReport.pdf
A written summary of all analysis tasks, including:
Probability distribution calculations in Excel.
Statistical quantities from humidity data in R.
Regression plots and interpretation.
Diamond carat vs. price trend analysis.

LaurenBrampton_StatsProject2025.xlsx
Excel file containing:
Probability distribution scenarios and solutions.
Trendline analysis for diamond dataset.
Residuals and fitted values.

DS7.xlsx
Weather dataset used for analysis in R (e.g humidity, air pressure, windspeed, gust).

Highlights
Excel Probability Calculations
Used functions like BINOM.DIST, NORM.DIST, POISSON.DIST, and BINOM.DIST.RANGE to solve real life probability scenarios. Included normal approximation techniques.

R Analysis
Cleaned and converted weather data.
Computed 10 stat summaries of humidity.
Observed that most humidity values were between 84%–93%.

Regression in R and Excel
Created scatterplots for weather data.
Found a strong linear relationship between windspeed and gust speed using R.
In Excel, derived the regression line for diamond prices with equation y = 4018.7x - 888.75.
Achieved an R² of 0.9998, indicating a near linear relationship.

Conclusion
This project strengthened my skills in:
Interpreting and applying probability distributions.
Performing data cleaning and statistical analysis in R.
Understanding and applying regression concepts, residuals and standard error.

I now feel more confident using both Excel and R for statistical problem-solving in game development and beyond.
